Title: Mid Arm Quilting Machine

Creating a quilt can be one of the most beautiful crafting activities, but it can also be one of the most tedious.   When looking at quilts that were made entirely by hand generations ago, it's hard to imagine how much time and effort it took. Fortunately, technology has advanced to the point of creating equipment that makes doing even the biggest and most complex quilt easier than ever.  For many quilters, a mid-arm machine such as the Qnique Quilter works best for their projects.  Allowing for work on projects that earlier would have required a long-arm machine, these machines offer a variety of features that make sewing even the most complex quilt a pleasure.

Advantages of a Mid Arm Quilting Machine
For those quilters who want plenty of work space packed into a smaller machine, the Qnique Quilter does just that.  A mid arm quilting machine offers numerous advantages over traditional long arm machines, such as:
<ul>
<li>Extended Work Area</li>
<li>Multiple Accessory Ports</li>
<li>Dual Thread Towers</li>
<li>Built-in Stitch Regulation</li></ul>

In addition, a mid arm quilting machine is easier to control due to its quick-access buttons that allow for all functions of the machine to be controlled from its two handles, each of which contain three function buttons.

The Technology of Quilting
What make today's quilts so much easier to make are the advances in technology.  With computer automated software such as Quiltmotion available on these machines, the possibilities are endless when it comes to the patterns and styles that can be used on modern quilts.  Whether working on a standard block or one that's a little bigger, a mid arm quilting machine can do the job every time.

Mid Arms and Quilting Frames
For many quilters, one of their biggest problems is finding a machine that fits well with their quilting frame.  With a mid arm machine such as the Qnique Quilter, this is never an issue.  The Grace Company, which is considered the pioneer of quilting frames, offers two frames that work well with mid arm machines.  The SR-2 sets up in Queen or Crib size, while the recently-developed Qnique 14+ frame is a king-size version designed specifically for larger quilts.

Making the best quilt takes the right combination of skill, style and patience along with the best equipment.  For beginners as well as experienced quilters, using a mid arm quilting machine such as the Qnique Quilter can help turn an ordinary quilt into a true masterpiece.
