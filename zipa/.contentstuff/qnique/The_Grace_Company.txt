With the introduction of these features, Grace quickly became the company associated with quilting quality and began its ascension to the top.  

Computerized Technology
However, what truly set The Grace Company apart from other competitors was its embracing of computerized technology when it came to quilting. With its development of quilting pattern software, the company made it possible to see how a design would look before the first stitch was sewed.  In doing so, quilts could contain designs that were more intricate than ever before, and as a bonus would take far less time and effort than in previous years.  Some of the most popular quilting software programs have included:
